# package-testpypi.yml

This workflow will build the package using the
[`hynek/build-and-inspect-python-package`](https://github.com/hynek/build-and-inspect-python-package)
action, upload the package to [TestPyPI](https://test.pypi.org), and then verify that the package
can be installed from [TestPyPI](https://test.pypi.org).

In order to ensure each version uploaded to [TestPyPI](https://test.pypi.org) is unique, the
workflow will first create a unique `.postN` version number for the package on top of the
officially released version of the package, incrementing `N` each time the workflow runs.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When uploading the Python package to [test.pypi.org](https://test.pypi.org), this workflow
> will run in the `package-testpypi` GitHub Actions environment. It is recommended to
> limit this environment to only the `main` branch. It is also recommended to store the token
> for uploading to [test.pypi.org](https://test.pypi.org) as an environment secret so that it can only be
> accessed by the `package-testpypi` environment. This secret will need to be passed in as a
> secret when calling the reusable workflow, see the [example](#example) below.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When calling this reusable workflow, the permissions must be set as follows:
>
> ```yaml
> permissions:
>   contents: read
>   id-token: write
>   attestations: write
> ```

> [!NOTE]
> This workflow uses concurrency to limit the number of builds that can run at the same time
> to a single build. This concurrency is shared across the `'pypi (Reusable Workflows)'` concurrency
> group within the repo that calls this workflow.

> [!NOTE]
> This workflow uses the following GitHub Actions:
>
> - [actions/checkout](https://github.com/actions/checkout)
> - [tektronix/python-package-ci-cd/actions/create_unique_testpypi_version](https://github.com/tektronix/python-package-ci-cd)
> - [hynek/build-and-inspect-python-package](https://github.com/hynek/build-and-inspect-python-package)
