# test-code.yml

This workflow will run the tests for the code in the repository that are defined by its
[`tox`](https://tox.wiki/en/stable/) configuration. The test results
(anything matching the `.results*/**` glob) and coverage data (matching the `.coverage*` glob)
will be uploaded as artifacts and code coverage results can optionally be uploaded to the Codecov application.

This workflow runs two categories of tox environments: a general category and a fast category. The
fast category is intended to run just the unit tests, while the general category should run a
more comprehensive set of linting, build checks, and tests. The general category needs to use the
[`tox-gh-actions`](https://pypi.org/project/tox-gh-actions/) Python package to be able to run
specific tox environments based on the installed Python version. The fast category runs the
`[testenv:tests]` tox environment and needs to use the
[`pytest-github-report`](https://pypi.org/project/pytest-github-report/) Python package in order
to create a markdown file that can be uploaded as an artifact and then used by the
[`publish-test-results.yml`](./publish-test-results.md) workflow to add comments to Pull Requests
that contain the test results.

See this sample tox configuration for an example of how to set up the tox environments so that
this workflow can be used. This example makes use of the following Python packages:

- Required to use this workflow:
    - [`tox`](https://pypi.org/project/tox/)
    - [`tox-gh-actions`](https://pypi.org/project/tox-gh-actions/)
    - [`pytest`](https://pypi.org/project/pytest/)
    - [`pytest-cov`](https://pypi.org/project/pytest-cov/)
    - [`pytest-html`](https://pypi.org/project/pytest-html/)
    - [`pytest-github-report`](https://pypi.org/project/pytest-github-report/)
- Used only in the example:
    - [`poetry`](https://pypi.org/project/poetry/)
    - [`twine`](https://pypi.org/project/twine/)
    - [`pre-commit`](https://pypi.org/project/pre-commit/)

> [!NOTE]
> This workflow uses concurrency to limit the number of builds that can run at the same time
> to a single build. For builds on the `main` branch, the workflow will simply create a queue.
> For builds on other branches (or builds triggered by Pull Requests), the workflow will cancel
> any currently running builds for the same branch (or Pull Request).
