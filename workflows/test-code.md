# test-code.yml

This workflow will run the tests for the code in the repository that are defined by its
[`tox`](https://tox.wiki/en/stable/) configuration. The test results
(anything matching the `.results*/**` glob) and coverage data (matching the `.coverage*` glob)
will be uploaded as artifacts and code coverage results can optionally be uploaded to the Codecov application.

This workflow runs two categories of tox environments: a general category and a fast category. The
fast category is intended to run just the unit tests, while the general category should run a
more comprehensive set of linting, build checks, and tests. The general category needs to use the
[`tox-gh-actions`](https://pypi.org/project/tox-gh-actions/) Python package to be able to run
specific tox environments based on the installed Python version. The fast category needs to use the
[`pytest-github-report`](https://pypi.org/project/pytest-github-report/) Python package in order
to create a markdown file that can be uploaded as an artifact and then used by the
[`publish-test-results.yml`](./publish-test-results.md) workflow to add comments to Pull Requests
that contain the test results.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> In order for the Codecov upload to work, a `CODECOV_TOKEN` secret must be available to the
> calling workflow, and secrets must be set to `inherit`.

See this sample tox configuration for an example of how to set up the tox environments so that
this workflow can be used. This example makes use of the following Python packages:

- Required to use this workflow:
    - [`tox`](https://pypi.org/project/tox/)
    - [`tox-gh-actions`](https://pypi.org/project/tox-gh-actions/)
    - [`pytest`](https://pypi.org/project/pytest/)
    - [`pytest-cov`](https://pypi.org/project/pytest-cov/)
    - [`pytest-html`](https://pypi.org/project/pytest-html/)
    - [`pytest-github-report`](https://pypi.org/project/pytest-github-report/)
- Used only in the example:
    - [`poetry`](https://pypi.org/project/poetry/)
    - [`twine`](https://pypi.org/project/twine/)
    - [`pre-commit`](https://pypi.org/project/pre-commit/)

| ------------------------- | --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| `repo-name`               | required  | The full name of the repository to use to gate Codecov uploads, in the format `owner/repo`. |                                    |
| `python-versions-array`   | required  | A valid JSON array of Python versions to test against.                                      |                                    |
| `operating-systems-array` | optional  | A valid JSON array of operating system names to run tests on.                               | `'["ubuntu", "windows", "macos"]'` |
| `upload-codecov`          | optional  | A boolean indicating if coverage results should be uploaded to Codecov.                     | `false`                            |
