# package-build.yml

This workflow will build the package using the
[`hynek/build-and-inspect-python-package`](https://github.com/hynek/build-and-inspect-python-package)
action, and then verify that the package can be installed on each combination of Python version
and operating system specified.

> [!NOTE]
> When building the Python package, this workflow will run in the `package-build` GitHub Actions environment.
> This environment will be created in the repository that calls this workflow. No additional setup is required.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When calling this reusable workflow, the permissions must be set as follows:
>
> ```yaml
> permissions:
>   contents: read
>   id-token: write
>   attestations: write
> ```

> [!NOTE]
> This workflow uses concurrency to limit the number of builds that can run at the same time
> to a single build. For builds on the `main` branch, the workflow will simply create a queue.
> For builds on other branches (or builds triggered by Pull Requests), the workflow will cancel
> any currently running builds for the same branch (or Pull Request).

> [!NOTE]
> This workflow uses the following GitHub Actions:
>
> - [actions/checkout](https://github.com/actions/checkout)
> - [hynek/build-and-inspect-python-package](https://github.com/hynek/build-and-inspect-python-package)
> - [actions/download-artifact](https://github.com/actions/download-artifact)
> - [actions/setup-python](https://github.com/actions/setup-python)
> - [re-actors/alls-green](https://github.com/re-actors/alls-green)
>
> See the [Workflow file][workflow-file] for the currently used versions of each GitHub Action.

> [!TIP]
> See the [Workflow file][workflow-file] for implementation details.
