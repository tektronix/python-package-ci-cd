# sbom-scan.yml

This workflow will create a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) for the repository using the
[`anchore/sbom-action`](https://github.com/anchore/sbom-action) Action and then scan the SBOM
using the [`anchore/scan-action`](https://github.com/anchore/scan-action) Action. It runs on the `ubuntu-latest` runner label,
uses the default version of Python available on the runner, and will use the latest compatible
version of [`poetry`](https://pypi.org/project/poetry/) to generate the lock file for the calling
repository's Python package.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> In order to use this workflow, the Python package must be using the
> [Poetry package manager](https://python-poetry.org/).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When calling this reusable workflow, the permissions must be set as follows:
>
