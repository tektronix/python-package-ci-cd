# package-release.yml

This workflow will create a new release of the package using the
[`python-semantic-release`](https://python-semantic-release.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) tool.
It will then build the package, upload the package to
[TestPyPI](https://test.pypi.org) and [PyPI](https://pypi.org),
create a new GitHub Release for the project,
and then verify that the package can be installed from
[TestPyPI](https://test.pypi.org) and [PyPI](https://pypi.org).

This workflow runs an action that will populate two files in the
[`python-semantic-release` templates directory](https://python-semantic-release.readthedocs.io/en/latest/configuration.html#config-changelog-template-dir).
One of those files will contain the contents of the `CHANGELOG.md` file in the
repo prior to creating the new release. The other file will contain the
contents of the `## Unreleased` section of the `CHANGELOG.md` file that
will be used to fill in the GitHub Release Notes.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This workflow requires the `CHANGELOG.md` file to be in a format that is based on
> [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com)
> (the primary difference is the `## [Unreleased]` section is replaced by an `## Unreleased` section),
> and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org). See this repo's
> [CHANGELOG.md](../CHANGELOG.md) for an example of the format to use.
>
> Valid subsections within a version are:
>
> - Added
> - Changed
> - Deprecated
> - Removed
> - Fixed
> - Security

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This workflow uses several GitHub Actions environments.
>
> The `bump-version` job runs in the
> `package-release-gate` environment. It is recommended to limit this environment to only the
> `main` branch as well as enable the `Required reviewers` setting to enforce approval
> before creating a new release of the package. It is also recommended to store the token used
> to check out the repo and the SSH public/private keys as environment secrets so that
> they can only be used by the `package-release-gate` environment. These secrets will need to be
> passed in as secrets when calling the reusable workflow, see the [example](#example) below.
>
> The `upload-testpypi` job (run when `inputs.build-and-publish-python-package == true`) runs in the `package-testpypi` environment. It is recommended to
> limit this environment to only the `main` branch. It is also recommended to store the token
> for uploading to [test.pypi.org](https://test.pypi.org) as an environment secret so that it can only be
> accessed by the `package-testpypi` environment. This secret will need to be passed in as a
> secret when calling the reusable workflow, see the [example](#example) below.
>
> The `upload-pypi` job (run when `inputs.build-and-publish-python-package == true`) runs in the `package-release` environment. It is recommended to
> limit this environment to only the `main` branch. It is also recommended to store the token
> for uploading to [pypi.org](https://pypi.org) as an environment secret so that it can only be
> accessed by the `package-release` environment. This secret will need to be passed in as a
> secret when calling the reusable workflow, see the [example](#example) below.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When calling this reusable workflow, the permissions must be set as follows:
>
> ```yaml
> permissions:
>   contents: write
>   id-token: write
>   attestations: write
> ```

> [!NOTE]
> This workflow uses concurrency to limit the number of builds that can run at the same time
> to a single build. This concurrency is shared across the `'pypi (Reusable Workflows)'` concurrency
> group within the repo that calls this workflow.

> [!NOTE]
> This workflow uses the following GitHub Actions:
>
> - [actions/checkout](https://github.com/actions/checkout)
> - [tektronix/python-package-ci-cd/actions/find_unreleased_changelog_items](https://github.com/tektronix/python-package-ci-cd)
> - [python-semantic-release/python-semantic-release](https://github.com/python-semantic-release/python-semantic-release)
